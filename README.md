# This is a prototype

this is my prototype for "what about a game where you summon a bunch of small creatures to fight for you? where like the self replication is the creatures you create that replicate part of your powers?"

# Naming Conventions

Use snake_case for all file names

Use CamelCase for `class_name [name]` and Node Names / engine singletons.

# Structure

Our group needs to agree on the proper way to organize the project files.
