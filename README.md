# Project B I M P S (Builder, Inventor, Mozart, Picasso, S (many?))
## This is an early development build (dev-2.0), mechanics are subject to change.

This game is based on a character that one of our irl friends is playing as in our pathfinder 2e
campaign.

"what about a game where you summon a bunch of small creatures to fight for you? where like the self replication is the creatures you create that replicate part of your powers?"

## Naming Conventions

Use snake_case for all file names
