## This is an implementation of that, `deferred_velocity` node should have a
## physics process priority higher than this, meaning if this has a physics
## process priority of 2, `deferred_velocity` node should have priority 3 or above
## `body` physics process priority should be higher than `deferred_velocity`
##
## this is done to ensure that all accelerations are calculated using the previous
## frame's velocities, since otherwise the behavior can be inconsistient when
## one instance checks for the previous frame's other velocities while the
## next one checks a mix and then it all goes wrong
